#About

I'm a junior computer science major at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu), where I do fun things like play piano, break my computer, and study Arabic.

That last part's pretty important &mdash; it's why I'm going to [Lebanon](/lebanon/) for fall term 2010. It'll be great.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rouge8) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/andy.freeland), or you can laugh at my music on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/Rouge8).

If you actually want to contact me, I recommend emailing me at <andy@andyfreeland.net>.
