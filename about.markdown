I'm __Andy__. I'm a senior <a href="#programming">Computer Science major</a> at [Carleton College][1].

I also study a lot of <a href="#arabic">Arabic</a>.

If you want to get in touch with me you can [email me][2] or find me on [GitHub][3], [Twitter][4], or even [Facebook][5].

I also have [a resume][6] available.

## <a class="heading" name="programming">Programming</a>

I'm currently a senior Computer Science major at [Carleton College][7].

I've taken a lot of courses and worked on a few projects, but I'm currently interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web applications.

I've also worked as an Assistant Systems Administrator through school.

You can take a look at [my projects][8] to see some of the more interesting things I've worked on, or you can check me out on [GitHub][9].

## <a class="heading" name="arabic">Arabic</a>

I like Arabic. _A lot_. The language, the people, the music, the culture, the politics, whatever.

At Carleton, I've taken every Arabic class offered (_and more!_).
I also work as a teaching assistant for the department.

In Fall 2010, I went to [Lebanon][10] to study Arabic and explore the country. It was really awesome --- one of the best experiences of my life.

This summer, I'm going to be studying Arabic on the [Critical Language Scholarship Program in Amman, Jordan][11].
I suspect it'll be pretty great.
