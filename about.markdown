#About

I'm a junior computer science major at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu), where I do fun things like play piano, break my computer, and study Arabic.

That last part's pretty important &mdash; it's why I went to [Lebanon](/lebanon/) for fall term 2010. I wrote about most of my adventures and took almost 3000 pictures. It was terrific &mdash; one of the best experiences of my life.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rouge8) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/andy.freeland), or you can email me at <andy@andyfreeland.net>.

If you're interested, I also have a [resume](/resume.pdf) available.
