<h1 id="archive">Lebanon</h1>

<p>I spent fall term 2010 in Beirut, Lebanon studying Arabic at <a href="http://www.lau.edu.lb/centers-institutes/sinarc/">Lebanese American University</a>. It was wonderful. Those 15 weeks were probably the best experience of my life.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's still a few things I haven't written about, but I might add those someday.</p>

<p>Here you can see everything I've written about it. With pictures!</p>
