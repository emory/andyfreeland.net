# Projects

- [HITSearch](https://github.com/rouge8/hitsearch) &mdash; a super cool search engine and web crawler for a Data Mining class. Uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and made by me, [Dan Levy](http://danl3v.com) and [Conrad Dean](http://conradpdean.com).

- [andyfreeland.net](https://github.com/rouge8/andyfreeland.net) &mdash; this site, which I originally made to chronicle my journey to [Lebanon](/lebanon/). Written in [Markdown](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/maruku.html) and generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

- [20Q](https://github.com/rouge8/20questions) &mdash; a surprisingly good 20 questions AI and webapp made for an Artificial Intelligence class. Uses [web.py](http://webpy.org/) and made by me and [Dan Levy](http://danl3v.com).

More to come.
