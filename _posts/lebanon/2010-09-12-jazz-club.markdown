This weekend, in addition to Eid ul-Fitr, was Maraya 2010 &mdash; the Hamra Street Festival. It was neat. Hamra Street, normally packed with cars and incredibly obnoxious taxis, was instead full of tent shops and food and people and a few stages. Your typical street festival.

While wandering around the street festival, we saw a sign for a *Jazz Club* during its happy hour. Naturally, we went to the bar and paid a lot of money for a few drinks. We left for a while and wandered along Hamra some more until we decided to come back to hear the band play.

Good decision. The band was **amazing**. They didn't really play jazz; instead, they played some apparently well-known Arabic music. Our Lebanese and Palestinian friends told us that the songs were mostly from the 70's, during the [Lebanese Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_civil_war). The songs were largely about things like love, unity, and Lebanon. The unity part was kind of a big deal during the war.

The audience was really into the band and music, including us, although we didn't understand any of the lyrics, because, uh, Arabic! It was a pretty expensive night, but definitely worth it because the band was absolutely phenomenal and it was oodles of fun. Easily the most fun I've had in Beirut so far.
