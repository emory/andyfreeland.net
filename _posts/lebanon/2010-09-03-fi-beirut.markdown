I've been in Beirut for about 23 hours now, most of which I've spent sleeping. While I was awake, I learned a few things: 

* Everyone in the airport and on the airplane assumed I spoke French, which was confusing as hell.
* There are soldiers at the airport and that's sort of intimidating when you're tired and confused.
* People drive insanely and honk a lot. Seriously, I hear honking constantly through my window. It's worse than when I was in New York.
* 1500 Lebanese Lira = 1 USD

Lebanese American University is housing us in an apartment building a few blocks from campus and two buildings away from an actual residence hall. My building and *air-conditioned* apartment are pretty nice. **Much** nicer than anywhere I've lived at Carleton. I think I'm living with three other people, only two of which are here yet, and neither of whom I've spoken too because they've been asleep since I woke up this afternoon.

My building is in the [Hamra district](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamra_Street) which is pretty cool. It's extremely hot here (about 90&deg; F), but since it isn't humid, it feels nice.

More importantly, pictures:
