I lied about posting quickly. Three weeks ago we made our expedition to the southeast of Lebanon, in the [Chouf region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chouf) and the [Beqaa valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekaa_Valley).

The Chouf is the heartland of the Druze community, but there is also a fairly large Maronite population as well.

Our first stop was [Deir al-Qamar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al_Qamar), an old village where the governors of Lebanon resided between the 16th and 18th centuries. It was also at one point the literary capital of Lebanon. We walked around the village a bit and saw Fakhreddine Mosque, the oldest Mosque in Mount Lebanon, built in 1493. Pictured above.

There was also a pretty cool Maronite church. After we finished walking around the Deir al-Qamar, we got back on the bus and drove to another village, [Moukhtara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moukhtara).

As far as I can tell, Moukhtara is notable only for being the residence of the Jumblatt family. Part of the Jumblatt palace is pictured above.

The Jumblatt family has been one of the most prominent Druze families in Lebanon for several centuries, dating back to at least Ottoman rule. They had also traditionally been rulers or governors of much of the Chouf valley.
