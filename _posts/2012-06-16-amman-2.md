Today we actually left our neighborhood, for the very first time.

We went in groups with our speaking partners to Rainbow Street and Wasat al-Balad. There's a fairly well-known market in Rainbow Street called Souq Jara that is pretty touristy, but other than that they are very sha'bi neighborhoods. Literally that means popular, but a better translation might be something like working-class.

These neighborhoods reminded me a lot of [Tripoli in Lebanon](/lebanon/2010/10/07/trablus/). Crowded, dirty, and busy. I had falafel and hummus for the first time in Jordan from a comically cheap restaurant --- less than $1.50 for more than enough falafel and hummus.

There was also a concert by a local Jordanian band at Souq Jara: [JadaL](http://jadalband.com/). The most surprising thing about the concert (to me at least) was that they paused the concert in anticipation of the [call to prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan). It was good though. I don't instantly like them as much as [Mashrou3 Leila](http://mashrou3leila.com/) or [Adonis](http://www.adonisband.com/), but still a lot of fun. Also I think both Mashrou3 Leila and Adonis are going to have concerts in Jordan this summer, and I really really hope they're while I'm here, because if so, I am going.

The concert was also the first time I really saw Amman as beautiful. It's a great view.

This will serve as proof that I'm actually in Jordan.
