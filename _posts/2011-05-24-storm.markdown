There was a pretty nice storm this weekend. At first, this meant climbing onto a building, but eventually we retreated to a classroom.

Two pictures of lightning. I think the first is more interesting, although I wish something were in focus other than the bottom of the windowsill.

Finals are approaching and then another summer of work, but with more interesting projects.

This is not studying.
