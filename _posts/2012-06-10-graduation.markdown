Yesterday I graduated from Carleton College. Some people gave speeches, I shook some hands, and it was *really* hot.

It turns out I also made some friends in the past four years at Carleton.

In all seriousness, Carleton was an amazing experience.
I had tremendous opportunities, got to know really wonderful people,
and even learned a few things.

The people and experiences I've known at Carleton have done a lot to shape me into who I am today, and I think that's a good thing.

Bye-bye Carleton: it was great.
