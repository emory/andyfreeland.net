2:15am Saturday. Tired, bored, and raining outside. Natural response? Go to bed. Instead, I went for a walk downtown.

I like this picture. The old Malt-O-Meal Ames Mill, the Water Street bridge, and that wooden stair/deck contraption.

This is what I actually went downtown to get. Didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped. Not as many lights on in the mill as the last time I walked by, and I couldn't capture the churning water very well (read: at all). *ma3 leish*.
