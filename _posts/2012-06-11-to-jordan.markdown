Tomorrow I fly to Jordan to study Arabic even more.
I've already been in DC for orientation --- I left outrageously early the morning after graduation.

I'm going to be in Amman on the [Critical Language Scholarship][1] studying Arabic even more intensely
than when I was in [Lebanon][2]. I'm going from 8--9 hours per week of classes at Carleton to 20+ hours per week plus lots more homework.

I'll be in Jordan until 12 August, at which point I'm hoping to travel to some subset of Lebanon, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey. Probably Lebanon, Egypt, and Israel assuming I can get in.

I'm really good at relaxing after graduation.
Once I get there, I'll start writing and taking pictures of all the relaxation I'm doing. Be excited.
