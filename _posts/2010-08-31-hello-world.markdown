I've spent an embarassing amount of time the past two days making yet another blog. The idea is that I'll actually use this one, especially while I'm in Lebanon.

This is probably the first time I've ever done the design myself. As a result, it's heavily inspired by [Alex Payne](http://al3x.net) and [Tate Johnson](http://tatey.com), people with way cooler websites than mine. I'm using a static-site generator called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) so that I don't have to pay [my host's](http://nearlyfreespeech.net) dynamic site charge or MySQL charges. Posts are all written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and backed up on [Dropbox](http://getdropbox.com). Even better, I can deploy it automatically with [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/).

I've tested this in Firefox 3.6, Firefox 4, various versions of Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer 8. It worked in all of those, so if it doesn't work for you, [let me know](mailto:andy@andyfreeland.net).

This probably didn't interest you at all, but that's okay. Soon I'll be writing from Lebanon and I'll have interesting things to say.

Also, I spent over three hours getting that search box to center correctly when there are next and previous buttons. It was quite pathetic.
